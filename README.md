## Laboration in Logic For Computer Scientists

This laboration aims to develop programming skills in Prolog, problem solving and make use of learned outcomes in the course such as writing algorithms in Prolog for Natural Deduction, and implement a model checker for CTL.

### Description of Learning Outcomes for Different Tasks

#### Task 1: Basic Prolog.
- **Objective**: Gain familiarity with Prolog programming language, understand concepts such as unification and recursion, and learn to create functional code using Prolog.
- **Learning Outcome**: Acquire proficiency in basic Prolog syntax and semantics, demonstrate the ability to use unification and recursion effectively to solve problems, and develop functional programs in Prolog.

#### Task 2: Proof Checker in Natural Deduction
- **Objective**: Develop an automated algorithm for checking the validity of proofs written in natural deduction for propositional logic.
Provide a tool for users to easily verify the validity of sequents without manual proof construction.
- **Learning Outcome**: Understand the principles of natural deduction as a proof system for deriving and proving formulas in formal logic.
Implement an algorithmic approach to automate the verification process of proofs written in natural deduction for propositional logic.

#### Task 3: Model Checker in CTL
- **Objective**: Develop an advanced model checker using a combination of temporal logic and the Prolog programming language.
Create a tool capable of determining the validity of a non-trivial complex system based on given states and behaviors.
Utilize the model checker to prove logical assertions for a given network system, such as identifying dysfunctional system calls under erroneous pretenses.
- **Learning Outcome**: Understand the principles of temporal logic and its application in formal reasoning about system behavior.
Gain proficiency in programming with Prolog to implement logical inference and model checking algorithms.
Apply the developed model checker to analyze and verify the behavior of complex systems, particularly in network environments.
